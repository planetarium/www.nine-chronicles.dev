# Avatar Information Viewer Tutorial

This tutorial will show you how to easily fetch avatar information and create a board using [Mimir](../../general/get-state/get-state-with-mimir-graphql), a service that allows you to easily query the latest state of Nine Chronicles with GraphQL.

# Project Setup

We will use [React](https://react.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to quickly create the front end of our project.

```sh
npx create-react-app some-app-name --template @planetarium/9c-mimir-gql
```

First, let's set up a basic project configuration using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and run it to make sure everything is working.

```sh
cd some-app-name
npm run codegen
npm run start
```

Once the initialization is confirmed to be successful, you're ready to proceed!

## Modify the QueryTemplate

Since you downloaded the template using create-react-app, most settings required to use Mimir GQL are already configured.

If you want to modify the query fetched by GQL, you can edit the `src/graphql/api.graphql` file. To fetch more information related to the avatar, let's modify the query to include the action point as shown below.

```graphql
query GetAvatarInformation($avatarAddress: Address!) {
  avatar(address: $avatarAddress) {
    address
    name
    level
  }
  actionPoint(address: $avatarAddress)
}
```

Once modifications are made, the changes need to be applied to the Client that requests the query. This can be done automatically using the `graphql-codegen` library, which is already set up. You can generate the necessary code by running the codegen command.

```sh
npm run codegen
```

## Modify App.tsx

Now that we have updated the query and the client, it's time to modify the `src/App.tsx` code.

We will use the previously updated `GetAvatarInformation` query via the `useGetAvatarInformationQuery` function to make the actual request. Since we have updated the client, the response from this function will now include action point information, which we can display it.

```typescript
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useGetAvatarInformationQuery } from "./graphql/generated/graphql";
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const [avatarAddress, setAvatarAddress] = useState('');
  const [addressToFetch, setAddressToFetch] = useState('');

  const { loading, data } = useGetAvatarInformationQuery({
    variables: { avatarAddress: addressToFetch },
    skip: !addressToFetch
  });

  const handleFetch = () => {
    setAddressToFetch(avatarAddress);
  };

  return (
    <div className="app">
      <header className="app-header">
        <div className="input-group">
          <input
            type="text"
            value={avatarAddress}
            onChange={(e) => setAvatarAddress(e.target.value)}
            placeholder="Enter avatar address"
          />
          <button onClick={handleFetch}>Fetch</button>
        </div>

        {loading ? (
          <p>Loading...</p>
        ) : (
          <>
            {data && data.avatar ? (
              <>
                <p>Avatar Name: {data.avatar.name}</p>
                <p>Avatar Level: {data.avatar.level}</p>
                {/* Action Point Data */}
                <p>Action Point: {data.actionPoint}</p>
              </>
            ) : (
              <p>No data available</p>
            )}
          </>
        )}
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Completion

All modifications are complete. Now, restart the server and enter an avatar address to check it out.

```sh
npm run start
```

You can find the avatar address on [9cscan](https://9cscan.com/), and an example of an avatar address is "0x2E2dDdf0adC57b3C88E3ce3dBf2d3Eb5b9C41227".
All contents are available in the [9c-examples](https://github.com/planetarium/9c-examples/tree/main/avatar-information) repository, so feel free to refer to it.
Mimir GQL has many types that allow you to query information related to 9c. Utilize them to create your own application!
