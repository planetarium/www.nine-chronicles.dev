# Issuing Transactions: Using `Chrono`

Among the various ways to issue transactions on the Nine Chronicles blockchain network, we'll explore how to do it using `Chrono`.  
`Chrono` is a Chrome browser extension that functions similarly to `MetaMask`.  
With `Chrono`, you can register your private key, configure your desired network, and sign and propagate transactions requested by web apps.

## Installing Chrono

Follow [this guide](../../general/chrono/how-to-use-chrono) to install Chrono.

### Adding Your Local Node as a Network

1. First, start your local node:
    ```sh
    9crun run --version=v200220 --planet=Single
    ```
2. Next, retrieve the hash of the genesis block by running the following query in the [GraphQL Playground](http://127.0.0.1:31280/ui/playground):
    ```graphql [Query]
    query {
      nodeStatus {
        genesis {
          hash
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    ```json [Result]
    {
      "data": {
        "nodeStatus": {
          "genesis": {
            "hash": "37fb1963ababf73045aa036b347971089337945c94bc4e92a694c435b80a1f17"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    In this example, the genesis block hash for my local network is `37fb1963ababf73045aa036b347971089337945c94bc4e92a694c435b80a1f17`.

With this information, your local network configuration should look like this:

```
- Planet ID: 0x999999999999
- Network Name: My local
- Genesis Hash: 37fb1963ababf73045aa036b347971089337945c94bc4e92a694c435b80a1f17
- GraphQL endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:31280/graphql
- Explore endpoint:
- Is Mainnet: false
```

The Planet ID is just an identifier, and you can use any value as long as the format is consistent.

### Adding the Network to `Chrono`

Now, let’s register the local network with `Chrono`. Open `Chrono`, click the `odin` button in the upper left, and then select `Add New`.
![Add network to "Chrono"](/images/en/guide/issue-transaction/issue-transaction-with-chrono/add-network.png){width=360}

You'll see a UI for entering network information, as shown below. Fill in the details and click `Import`.

After a moment, your `My local` network will be successfully added.

Next, follow [this guide](../../general/chrono/how-to-use-chrono#register-private-key) to import the private key you created.

> In the screenshot above, you can see that the selected account in `Chrono` has 3,920 NCG. This balance reflects the block mining rewards accumulated on the private key used to run the local node. Since this is the same account selected in `Chrono`, the NCG balance is displayed.

## Issuing a Transaction Using the `Chrono` Example Project

The following is a simple example site where you can test `Chrono`. We'll issue a transaction to create an avatar on your local node and verify the result.

If `Chrono` is installed correctly, you’ll see the following screen when you visit the site. Click the `Connect` button.

`Chrono` will prompt you to enter your password.
![alt text](/images/en/guide/issue-transaction/issue-transaction-with-chrono/image-1.png){width=240}

Enter your password and click `Unlock`.
![alt text](/images/en/guide/issue-transaction/issue-transaction-with-chrono/image-2.png){width=240}

Select the account you want to connect and click `Approve`. In this example, instead of the default `Account 1`, we’ll connect with the `My private key` account that was added by importing the plain-text private key.
![alt text](/images/en/guide/issue-transaction/issue-transaction-with-chrono/image-3.png){width=360}

After a short wait, the account connection is successful. Since this account doesn’t have an avatar yet, the `Create Avatar 0` button is enabled. Click this button.
![alt text](/images/en/guide/issue-transaction/issue-transaction-with-chrono/image-4.png){width=480}

`Chrono` will display the details of the avatar creation transaction. Click the `Approve` button to sign and propagate the transaction to the connected network.
![alt text](/images/en/guide/issue-transaction/issue-transaction-with-chrono/image-5.png){width=360}

After a short wait, you’ll see that an avatar named `Avatar0` has been created. The `(120/120)` represents the `ActionPoint` status used in the game.

### Checking the State

Finally, let’s query the new avatar information on your local node using the [GraphQL Playground](http://127.0.0.1:31280/ui/playground).

::: code-group
```graphql [Query]
query {
  stateQuery {
     agent(address: "{your address}") {
      avatarStates {
        address
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```json [Result]
{
  "data": {
    "stateQuery": {
      "agent": {
        "avatarStates": [
          {
            "address": "0xD73e10DBE0184bE3284E0e5ca6A2A12ae80ca524",
            "name": "Avatar0"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "extensions": {}
}
```
:::

You can now confirm the state of the newly created avatar. The above GraphQL query allows you to retrieve the avatar's address and name, confirming that the avatar was successfully created.
