# Getting Started

Welcome! In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to set up and run the Nine Chronicles blockchain network, which was built using [libplanet](https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet).  
By the end of this guide, you'll be familiar with running nodes, querying data, and even creating a genesis-block taking you through all the steps needed to start your own network from scratch.

Let's dive into the concepts and technologies that power the Nine Chronicles blockchain network!

## Installing .NET SDK 6

First things first, you'll need to install .NET SDK 6, which is essential for running the tools we'll be using throughout this tutorial.  
The .NET SDK is available for various operating systems. Download and install the appropriate version for your system from the link below:
[https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)

After the installation is complete, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to verify that .NET SDK was installed correctly:

```shell
dotnet --version
```

If the installation was successful, you should see the version number of the installed .NET SDK, such as "6.0.100".

With .NET SDK 6 successfully installed, you’re ready to move on to the next step.
