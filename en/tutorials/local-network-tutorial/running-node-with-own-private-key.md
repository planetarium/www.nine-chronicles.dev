# Running a Nine Chronicles Blockchain Node with Your Own Private Key

In a previous exercise, we ran a node using the `Headless.Executor`. This time, we’ll explore how to run a node using a custom private key and a genesis block that you’ve created.

## 1. Modifying `appsettings`

First, you need to modify the settings file for the Single node, located at `~/.planetarium/headless/appsettings/appsettings.Single.json`.  
Replace the `MinerPrivateKeyString`, `ConsensusPrivateKeyString`, and `ConsensusSeedStrings` with the values from your new private key.

```json
{
  ...
  "MinerPrivateKeyString": "9fe5f7c309495d284ca36b948fdeca0e65b21a019e2f8a03efd849df88fab102", // [!code --]
  "MinerPrivateKeyString": "{your private key}", // [!code ++]
  "ConsensusPrivateKeyString": "9fe5f7c309495d284ca36b948fdeca0e65b21a019e2f8a03efd849df88fab102", // [!code --]
  "ConsensusPrivateKeyString": "{your private key}", // [!code ++]
  "ConsensusSeedStrings": [
    "033dafc7bf6d603578a8c51b04430b738aeeead8a012e1dcbd8c75cf18a625cf14,127.0.0.1,31588" // [!code --]
  ],
  "ConsensusSeedStrings": [
    "{your public key},127.0.0.1,31588" // [!code ++]
  ],
  ...
}
```

## 2. Replacing the Genesis Block

Next, navigate to `~/.planetarium/headless/genesis-block/genesis-block-for-single`, where the automatically generated genesis block is stored.  
Replace the existing `genesis-block-for-single` file with the new genesis block file you created during the previous exercise.

## 3. Deleting the Existing Store

To reset the node configuration and remove any previous data tied to the old private key, delete the existing store folder  
Delete the folder at `~/.planetarium/headless/store/v200220`.

## 4. Running the Node

Now it's time to run the node. Use the following command:

```sh
9crun run --version=v200220 --planet=Single
```

This command will ensure that the node runs with your new private key and genesis block, even if previous files existed. The logs should look something like this:

## 5. Verifying the Node is Using Your Private Key

To confirm that the node is running with your private key, use GraphQL to query the blockchain's status. Access [Local Headless](http://127.0.0.1:31280/ui/playground) and run the following query:

```graphql
query {
  nodeStatus {
    tip {
      miner
      hash
      index
    }
  }
}
```

![NodeStatus Query Result](/images/network/nodestatus-query.png)

In the query result, check that the `miner` field shows the address corresponding to the private key you provided.

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to run a node using your unique private key.  
The next step is to launch the game client on your local network.
