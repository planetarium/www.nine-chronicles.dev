# **Modathon**

[Nine Chronicles](https://docs.nine-chronicles.com/introduction) is a decentralized idle RPG built on blockchain technology.  
Over time, the community has created many exciting mods, and now, we want to see even more contributions. To support this, we're launching the **Nine Chronicles Modathon** with a prize pool of **225,000 NCG**.

We've written several documents to make modding easier, so check them out:
- [beginner's guide](./for-non-developer) so that **beginners** can participate.
- For **weapon crafters**, we've created a [guide for weapon crafters](./for-weapon-crafter).

Let's shape the future of Nine Chronicles together and turn your ideas into reality!🎮✨

## **Purpose of the Modathon**

The primary goal of the Nine Chronicles Modathon is to **strengthen** the Nine Chronicles modding ecosystem and **grow the number of community developers**. We hope that the projects created during the Modathon will **continue to evolve** and be used long after the event ends. 🚀

Additionally, since all Nine Chronicles-related products are open-source, we encourage participants to **contribute to them**, fostering a collaborative and ongoing development process.

## **Modathon Detail**

### **Introduction to the Modathon**

The Modathon is **a type of hackathon** where participants compete by creating mods.  
**Aim for first place by making a mod that players will love!** 🏆

You can make **any kind of mod related to Nine Chronicles**. Feel free to create mods for websites, client modifications, weapon images, and more.
**Promote your mod** during the event to earn positive feedback from the community. 📣

**Seven days before the event concludes**, we’ll hold a **community vote** to see which mod is most popular among users. The results will serve as a reference for the judging process, with internal rankings determining the final rewards.

There are **no genre restrictions** on mods - website or client modifications are all welcome. If you're not a developer but want to **learn to develop and get involved**, check out the [beginner's guide](./for-non-developer), and if you want to **create weapons and get involved**, check out the [weapon crafter's guide](./for-weapon-crafter). 💡

### **How to Participate**

The Nine Chronicles Modathon will primarily take place on the **[Planetarium Dev Discord](https://bit.ly/3Bf9oer)** server.  
However, participants will have `#mod-showcase` on the main **Planetarium Discord** server to promote their mods, and you can also list your mod in the GitHub repository at [awesome-9c](https://github.com/planetarium/awesome-9c).

For event-related questions, a Q&A channel will be available `#2024modathon` on the **Planetarium Dev** server, and feedback on mods can be shared through the `#introduce-mods` channel. You’re also welcome to use your own Discord or website if you prefer.

💡 **Have a mod idea?** Feel free to post it in the `#mod-ideas` channel on the **Planetarium Dev or Planetarium** server, where you can also find developers to collaborate with!
